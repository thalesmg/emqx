Added listener shutdown counts labeled by shutdown reason to Prometheus metrics, under the `emqx_client_disconnected_reason` counters.

Example output:

```
emqx_client_disconnected_reason{node="emqx@127.0.0.1",reason="takenover"} 1
emqx_client_disconnected_reason{node="emqx@127.0.0.1",reason="kicked"} 1
```
